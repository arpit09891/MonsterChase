I have written this code between Aug 2016 - Feb 2017. I feel this doesn't represent my current abilities in C++. However, it shows basic understanding.

Engine Includes:
• Developed a custom game engine with heap manager and fixed size memory manager which supports multiple alignment allocation, and   
   gaurdbanding, float point checks, multithread file loading support, custom smart and weak pointers.  
• Created custom operator new, delete, placement new/delete, new[]/delete[]. 
• Implemented motion, physics, and 2D collision detection
